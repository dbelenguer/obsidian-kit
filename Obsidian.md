# Obsidian

Obsidian is a powerful and extensible knowledge base that works on top of your local folder of plain text files.

Using [[links]] and #tags you can organise or your notes organically.

If you click in the word `links` in the previous sentence a new note will be created. You can use this if you plan to do a note for that concept at some point and you want to have the link already in place.

Regarding links, there's a tab on your right with the backlinks to this note, linked or unlinked mentions.

## Shortcuts 

- `⌘ + O` to find or create a note
- Tap `shift` 2 times to open the command palette 
- `⌘ + ,` to open Obsidian's settings
- `⌘ + ⌥ + L` Lint file with the [[#Linter]] plugin 
- `⌘ + E` toggle reading view

Create you own! You can even insert a template previously created

## Installed Plugins

### Community plugins 

#### Calendar

#### Dataview

Dataview is a live index and query engine over your personal knowledge base. You can [**add metadata**](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/annotation/add-metadata/) to your notes and **query** them with the [**Dataview Query Language**](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/queries/structure/) to list, filter, sort or group your data. Dataview keeps your queries always up to date and makes data aggregation a breeze.

[Reference](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)

There goes an example, a list from the tag #tag, the notes having this tag appear here:
```dataview
LIST
FROM #tag
```

#### Doubleshift

Open the command palette by pressing `shift` twice and create your own shortcuts

#### Excalidraw

Integrates [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), a feature rich sketching tool, into Obsidian. You can store and edit Excalidraw files in your vault, you can embed drawings into your documents, and you can link to documents and other drawings to/and from Excalidraw.

#### Extract url content

Transforms a URL to markdown view if the website allows it. Select a link and execute the `Extract url content` command (you can use [[#Doubleshift]]).

Anyway, as an advice: try just write your own notes in your vault.

#### Kanban

Markdown-based kanban board. It's configured to use an already created template if you create a note from a task.

#### Linter

Formats and styles your notes with a focus on configurability and extensibility.  
Rules can be toggled and configured in the settings.

#### Natural Language Dates

Handy plugin to create a link to a date, like `@today`

#### Note Refactor

Refactor notes extracting selection on a new note or splitting the current note
