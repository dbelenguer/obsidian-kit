# Backup your vault periodically

This note was created on 2023-02-02 16:27.

## Description

[[Obsidian]] does not provide any (free) vault backup.

You can:
- Use cloud providers like dropbox or google drive to sync your local changes. There are plugins that takes care of it for you (haven't tried any)
- Version your vault as a git repository and have a remote repository like github configured. [[Obsidian#Obsidian Git]] works well for me, it periodically commits and pushes all the changes in your vault
