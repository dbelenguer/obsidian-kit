# Obsidian kit

Little Obsidian kit, with the tools I use and some suggestions about how to use it, based on daily note taking that can lead to knowledge base building.

This is just a starting point, find whatever works for you!

## Steps

Steps to have your own vault running:

- Download:
	- Obsidian from https://obsidian.md/
	- This repository
- Setup:
	- Open Obsidian
	- Select `Open folder as vault`
	- Use the `vault` folder from this repo as your vault (rename it before if you want a different name)
- Start your knowledge base:
	- Read some of the already created notes (if you want)
	- Open the `Kanban` note, you should see a working Kanban ready to use
	- Check the tasks, the `backup` one is important
	- Go!
